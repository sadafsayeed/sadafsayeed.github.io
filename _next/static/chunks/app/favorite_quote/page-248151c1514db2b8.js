Every time I feel like giving up, I remind myself of this truth. Too often, people quit long before they realize what they are capable of - I almost did too. When I first started running, I was inexperienced and out of shape. I made the decision to finally get up and challenge myself. At first, it was brutal - I could barely run half a mile without gasping for air. But I did not stop. I kept pushing through the discomfort, the self-doubt, and the pain. Eventually, I completed my first 5K in 30 minutes. That journey taught me that nothing is impossible. We are the ones who shape who we become. You do not need to be born with talent-you just need the grit to carve it out from within. Because at the end of the day, hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard."})]})})}},6092:e=>{e.exports={style:{fontFamily:"'IBM Plex Mono', 'IBM Plex Mono Fallback'",fontStyle:"normal"},className:"__className_11c30a"}}},e=>{var t=t=>e(e.s=t);e.O(0,[601,259,441,684,358],()=>t(132)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
